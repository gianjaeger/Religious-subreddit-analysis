# religious-subreddit-analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyse the differences and similarities across the subreddits r/christianity, r/buddhism, r/islam and r/atheism. 1000 posts are scrapped for each subreddit and then assessed with reference to TF-IDF scores, PMI and lexicon analysis. We also train a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify posts into the four subreddits. The final presentation can also be found in this repository.
