# religious-subreddit-analysis

This project was a formative assignment for Fundamentals of Data Science as a part of the MSc Social Data Science program at the Oxford Internet Institute, taught by Bernie Hogan.

The project was a joint effort by Ami Kashimna, Gian Jaeger, Jennifer Gossen, Mattéo Larrodé and Mimi Chen.

The purpose of this project is to analyse the differences and similarities across the subreddits r/christianity, r/buddhism, r/islam and r/atheism. 1000 posts are scrapped for each subreddit and then assessed with reference to TF-IDF scores, PMI and lexicon analysis. We also train a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify posts into the four subreddits.
